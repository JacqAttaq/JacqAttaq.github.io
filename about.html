<h2> Think  Speak  Code</h2>
<body> 
  <p>Born and raised in Vermont, I will malfunction without regular doses of pure Maple Syrup.
  </p>
  <p>I moved to South Carolina to get away from snow, ice, and yeti.
  </p>
  <p>I've delivered pizzas (I know where I am), been a tour guide (I know what's going on), and even worked customer support for a website (I can explain anything to anyone). I learned to code at the Iron Yard and am now a Ruby on Rails engineer. I'm excited to join the tech community while continuing to learn and gain new skills.
